ARC_Calculator.py,ARC-REF-001,CRITICAL,Wrong source cited for ARC (uses 'SORA 2.5 Annex B Table B-1'),"Replace all ARC references with Step 4 + Annex C (Table C.1 for initial ARC & Table C.2 for strategic reduction). Reserve Annex D for TMPR; Annex B is for ground-risk mitigation assurance, not ARC.","EASA eRules UAS (Jul 2024): Table C.1 & C.2, Step 4. citeturn17view2 ; JARUS SORA v2.5 Annex B = Integrity & Assurance (not ARC). citeturn10search10",“Table C.1 — Initial air risk class assessment … After determining the initial risk … Table C.2 … new lowered (residual) ARC.”,Aligns terminology and tables with the governing method; removes mis-citation that could mislead validation and authority review.,"Cross-check code comments/docs reference to Annex C (C.1, C.2) and Step 4. Ensure TMPR calls point to Annex D."
ARC_Calculator.py,ARC-AEC-002,MAJOR,AEC range limited to 1–9 in docs/logic,"Support full AEC set 1–12 (incl. 10, 11, 12). Add handling for AEC 11 (> FL600) and AEC 12 (atypical/segregated airspace).","EASA eRules UAS (Jul 2024): Table C.1 lists AEC 1…12, incl. AEC 11 & AEC 12. citeturn17view2",“12 operational/airspace environments … correspond to the 12 scenarios … Table C.1.”,Hard‑limiting to 1–9 produces wrong ARC in edge cases and fails authority alignment.,Unit tests must include AEC 10/11/12 cases; verify initial ARC matches Table C.1 for all 12.
ARC_Calculator.py,ARC-ALT-003,CRITICAL,SORA 2.5 uncontrolled branch uses 120 m threshold,Standardize ALT threshold at 150 m AGL for ARC/AEC logic in 2.5 (both controlled and uncontrolled). Remove 120 m cutoff from ARC logic.,EASA eRules UAS (Jul 2024): Table C.1 uses 150 m (~500 ft) boundaries for < and > cases. citeturn17view2,“Operations below 150 m (~500 ft) AGL … Operations > 150 m (~500 ft) AGL …”,"120 m is an operational limit under 2019/947, not the AEC/ARC threshold in SORA tables.","Search code for “120” in 2.5 logic; replace with 150; rerun tests for urban/rural, controlled/uncontrolled paths."
ARC_Calculator.py,ARC-AIRPORT-004,CRITICAL,2.5 logic treats “near aerodrome + controlled” as AEC 7 / ARC-d,Remove distance‑based ‘near aerodrome’ branching. Use ‘airport/heliport environment’ categories directly: AEC 1 (B/C/D) and AEC 6 (E/F/G) per Table C.1.,EASA eRules UAS (Jul 2024): Table C.1 rows 'Airport/heliport environment'. citeturn17view2,"“OPS in an airport/heliport environment in class B, C or D … AEC 1 …; in class E or F or G … AEC 6 …”","AEC 7 is for <150 m in TMZ/Mode‑S veil, not ‘near aerodrome’. Distance heuristics aren’t in the SORA method.",Delete the ‘near aerodrome’ branch in 2.5; map airport/heliport environment to AEC 1/6; verify initial ARC equals C.1.
ARC_Calculator.py,ARC-UNCTRL-005,MAJOR,Fallback ‘≥120 m uncontrolled → consult authority’,Replace with explicit C.1 mappings: >150 m AGL uncontrolled over urban → AEC 4 (ARC‑c); over rural → AEC 5 (ARC‑c).,EASA eRules UAS (Jul 2024): Table C.1 AEC 4 & AEC 5 rows. citeturn17view2,“OPS > 150 m … uncontrolled … urban … AEC 4 …; … rural … AEC 5 …”,Spec provides explicit categories; ‘consult authority’ placeholder is non‑compliant and creates ambiguity.,Add tests for >150 m G‑airspace urban/rural; confirm ARC‑c per AEC 4/5.
ARC_Calculator.py,ARC-SM-006,CRITICAL,Strategic mitigation modeled as “each SM = −1 ARC level”,"Implement density‑based reduction per Table C.2: demonstrate local density equal to target rows (e.g., 4/3 → ARC‑c; 2/1 → ARC‑b), subject to competent‑authority acceptance.","EASA eRules UAS (Jul 2024): Table C.2 and surrounding text (Cols A–D, authority acceptance). citeturn17view2",“If the local density can be demonstrated … then the new lowered (residual) ARC … may be applicable.”,SORA does not use a ‘per‑mitigation decrement’; it uses evidence‑based density equivalence and approvals.,Replace counter‑based logic with density target evaluation and approval flag; replicate Examples 1–3 outcomes.
ARC_Calculator.py,ARC-ATYP-007,MAJOR,"Atypical/segregated treated only as a floor, not as an AEC category",Set initial AEC to 12 with ARC‑a when operation is in atypical/segregated airspace; don’t just alter the floor.,EASA eRules UAS (Jul 2024): Table C.1 AEC 12. citeturn17view2,“OPS in atypical/segregated airspace … AEC 12 … ARC‑a.”,"Spec defines atypical/segregated as its own AEC, not merely as an ARC floor control.",Add unit test: atypical/segregated → AEC 12 → initial ARC‑a; ensure residual logic respects C.2 note.
ARC_Calculator.py,ARC-ENV-008,MINOR,‘Suburban’ environment used as a decision category,Map ‘Suburban’ to ‘Urbanised area’ for AEC purposes; retain only Urban(ised) vs Rural in 2.5 logic.,EASA eRules UAS (Jul 2024): Table C.1 distinguishes ‘urbanised area’ vs ‘rural area’. citeturn17view2,“… over an urbanised area … over a rural area …”,Reduces ambiguity and aligns with tabular categories used by authorities.,Where environment == Suburban → treat as Urban for C.1/C.2 lookups; update tests accordingly.
ARC_Calculator.py,ARC-PROX-009,MAJOR,Fixed ‘near aerodrome’ distances (3 NM / 5 km) baked into ARC logic,Remove fixed radii from ARC logic. Determine ‘airport/heliport environment’ via authoritative aeronautical data (CTR/TIZ/ATZ/U‑space structures) rather than distance heuristics.,"EASA eRules UAS (Jul 2024): Table C.1 uses ‘airport/heliport environment’ categories, not distance thresholds. citeturn17view2",“Airport/heliport environment … AEC 1 … AEC 6 …”,Distance‑only proxies can misclassify and are not part of SORA’s AEC method.,Drive environment from AIP/ANSP datasets; add tests at identical distance inside vs outside CTR to prove logic.
ARC_Calculator.py,ARC-NAMING-010,MINOR,Terminology drift (‘Mode‑S veil’ variable naming and flags),"Standardise to ‘Mode‑S Veil’ / ‘TMZ’ and ensure variable names align (e.g., is_mode_s_veil). Include RMZ if used by local ANSP.",EASA eRules UAS (Jul 2024): Table C.1 explicitly lists Mode‑S Veil/TMZ. citeturn17view2,“OPS … in a Mode‑S Veil or transponder mandatory zone (TMZ)”,Ensures one‑to‑one mapping to table rows; reduces integration mismatches with airspace data providers.,Audit flags across API/logic; align to ‘Mode‑S Veil/TMZ’; update tests for AEC 2 and AEC 7 paths.
ARC_Calculator.py,ARC-TMPR-011,MAJOR,TMPR linkage not explicitly tied to Annex D in comments/flow,Document and implement TMPR per Annex D (tactical mitigation) after residual ARC; require performance level evidence per Annex D tables.,EASA SORA 2.5 Annex D — TMPR (EASA workshops overview). citeturn11search14,“Annex D — TMPR (tactical).”,Separates strategic (C.2) from tactical (Annex D) per 2.5 structure; simplifies authority review.,Add TMPR unit tests referencing Annex D performance outcomes; ensure sequence: Initial ARC → C.2 → TMPR.
ARC_Calculator.py,ARC-EX-012,MAJOR,Lack of conformance tests against official examples,"Add tests mirroring C.2 Examples 1–3 (AEC 1, 6, 9) to validate density‑based reductions to ARC‑c/ARC‑b.",EASA eRules UAS (Jul 2024): Examples 1–3 following Table C.2. citeturn17view2,“Example 1 … airport/heliport environment in class C … Example 2 … AEC 6 … Example 3 … AEC 9 …”,Authoritative sample cases ensure parity with regulator expectations and prevent regressions.,Implement unit tests that replicate Examples 1–3 outputs precisely.
ARC_Calculator.py,ARC-STRUCT-013,MINOR,Notes suggest ‘SM1–SM4’ taxonomy for air‑risk strategic mitigations,Rephrase to ‘strategic mitigation (density reduction) case’ and reference Table C.2 columns A–D; avoid counting ‘SMx’.,"EASA eRules UAS (Jul 2024): C.2 narrative focusing on density demonstration, not mitigation counts. citeturn17view2",“The strategic mitigation reduction case should be modelled after a safety case …”,Prevents misuse of ground‑risk mitigation nomenclature (M1/M2/M3) in air‑risk domain.,"Update docstrings; ensure UI/outputs speak in ‘density levels & evidence’, not ‘SM1/2/3/4’."
