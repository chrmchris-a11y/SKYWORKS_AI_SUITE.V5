SAFE OPERATION OF DRONES REGULATION AND NAA IMPLEMENTATION
PLAN DEVELOPMENT Workshop
Drone operations as well as their application is growing at fast pace requiring robust rules and processes to be
in place. EU Regulations 2019/947 and 2019/945 set the framework for the safe operation of drones and became
applicable on December 31, 2020. Transposition of those rules poses great challenge to project beneficiaries as
they would need to replace current national ones (where available) and invest significant resources for
implementation. The activity therefore aimed to facilitate better understanding of regulatory requirements and
implementation challenges.
The content of the workshop:
- Detailed overview of applicable regulations and its main benefits
- NAA implementation plan development and concept
- NAA resources, examples of procedures and tools in use (e.g. databases, software solutions)
- Challenges and solutions applied
- Practical examples - case studies (e.g. registration, scenarios)
The activity was implemented from 08 to 11 June 2021.
In total 20 participants from 6 project beneficiary National Aviation Authorities attended the workshop.
The “EASA-IPA5” project is funded by
the European Union and implemented
by EASA
