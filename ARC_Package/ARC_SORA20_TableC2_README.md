# ARC — SORA 2.0 (EASA AMC/GM) — Table C.2 Strategic Mitigations
Generated: 2025-10-30T09:38:15.591657Z

## Purpose
Reduce **iARC → residual (final) ARC** at **SORA Step 5** via **Strategic Mitigations** as per EASA AMC/GM (Annex C).

## Mitigation mechanisms (evidence-driven)
- **Airspace organisation / service arrangements** (e.g., segregated/reserved area, ATS arrangements)
- **Operational limitations**: boundary (geographical) and/or **chronology** (short exposure/time windows)
- **Procedural separation / coordination** with ATS/ANSP
- **Geo-awareness / geofencing constraints**

## Reduction rules
- Default cap: **≤ 1 class** reduction using “common structures & rules”.
- Larger reduction (up to **2 classes**) only with **certified segregation** meeting Annex C criteria.
- Sequence: compute iARC → apply selected strategic mitigation(s) → **cap** per rule → obtain **residual ARC**.

## Implementation contract
- Output: **residual_arc ∈ {a,b,c,d}**
- Log per mitigation: description, evidence reference (doc/URL), validity period, responsible party.
