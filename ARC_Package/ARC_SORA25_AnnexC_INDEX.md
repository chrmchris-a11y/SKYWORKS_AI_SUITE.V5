# ARC — SORA 2.5 (JARUS) — Annex C v1.0 Index
Generated: 2025-10-30T09:38:15.591657Z

## Purpose
Apply **Strategic Mitigation of Air Risk** to reduce **initial ARC → residual ARC** at **SORA Step 5** per JARUS SORA v2.5 **Annex C**.

## Mechanisms (high-level)
- **Airspace design / segregation** (including certified segregation)
- **Operational limitations**:
  - **Boundary** (geographical containment)
  - **Chronology / short exposure** (especially for VLOS with very short exposure) → up to **−1 class** where criteria are met
- **Procedural / service arrangements with ATS/ANSP**
- **Time-/Area-based traffic density reduction** (supported by data/evidence)

## Reduction caps & sequence
- Typical cap: **≤ 1 class** reduction via Annex C mechanisms.
- **Up to 2 classes** only with **certified segregation** satisfying Annex C.
- Sequence: determine **iARC (Main Body Step 4)** → apply Annex C mechanisms → enforce caps → **residual ARC**.

## Implementation notes
- Keep references to the **Main Body** section used for iARC and to the **Annex C** clause used for reduction.
