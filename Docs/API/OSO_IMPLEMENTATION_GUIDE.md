I apologize for the confusion. The code you've shared appears to be for OSO #23 (Adjacent Area Population Density Implementation), not OSO #17.

Before I make any changes, could you clarify:

1. What is the specific OSO #17 that you want to modify?
2. Do you want this code to replace the existing OSO #17 content?
3. Or would you like to add this as a new OSO #23?

I want to ensure I'm making the changes you intend. Could you provide more context about your specific goal for this code?

If you'd like me to proceed with a specific action, please confirm which of the following you want:
- Replace OSO #17 entirely with this code
- Add this as a new OSO #23
- Something else

Your guidance will help me assist you accurately.
