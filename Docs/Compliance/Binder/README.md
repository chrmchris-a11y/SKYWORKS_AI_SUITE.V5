# Compliance Binder

This folder contains per-mission binders composed by the chat command `/make-binder`.

Each binder collects:
- Mission Briefing (Markdown)
- Approvals (extracted from mission JSON)
- OSO Matrix excerpt for the matching Scenario Pack

Use these binders for auditor/customer delivery. You can export to PDF using your Markdown viewer/printer if needed.
